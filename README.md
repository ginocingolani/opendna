# Open DNA - Gino Cingolani Trucco
Introduction
------------

This git repository contains the genetic information for Gino Cingolani Trucco extracted using the Illumina Infinium Global Screening Array-24 v1.0 Bead Chip (GSA) — a.k.a. 23andMe version 5 or v5 —


File Information
------------

The text file consists of lines of your genotype call data (your A's, T's, C's and G's).
The downloaded file is 5 MB to 30 MB in size.
It can be opened in a text editor like SublimeText or Open Office Calc.


Why?
------------

A few years ago I've decided to genotype my DNA. I did it not only because I'm naturally curious but also because my father died of one of the most popular rare diseases: The Lou Ghering disease or Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) and I always wanted to have information about my organism and genome. As soon as the price point was below $300, I used the service of 23andme, a biotech start up to analyze my DNA genotype.
When he was diagnosed there was a lot of misunderstandings and delays between medical professionals regarding his status. I've always thought that it must be a better way to diagnose, that medical diagnosis should be similar to software development, that maybe, out there it was a doctor or geneticist interested on that particular disease and if the medical records of my father were available on the Internet the answers and the clarifications could come from anywhere in the world. On April 25th 2018 (The DNA Day in commemoration of the day in 1953 when James Watson, Francis Crick, Maurice Wilkins, Rosalind Franklin and colleagues published papers in the journal Nature on the structure of DNA.) I'm releasing my genetic raw data for anyone interested on using it for educational, artistic, research, entertainment or any other purpose.
